### Engine Stub
This example framework is a select file set that best highlights fundamentals in C++, general programming flow, and engine architecture.
I had many courses that required a personal rendering engine for homework assignments and projects, such as CS200, CS250, CS300, CS350, CS562 (all my graphics courses), and GAM400.

The example provided here was made alongside GAM400 and CS562 (Jan '22 - Apr '22), with any assignment code removed. I've also chosen to omit OpenGL source files since I'm primarily interested in showcasing C++ and not knowledge of third-party libraries.

These examples will be continuously updated to match the level of quality I aim for in my code.
