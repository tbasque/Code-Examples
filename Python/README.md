# Python
These examples are from my most recent course at DigiPen, Cryptography. This was my first time working with Python, so no advanced applications are done here. This is mostly to show how quickly I can adapt to a new language over the duration of a course at DigiPen (15 weeks).

When I wrote these programs, I used Python IDLE to call my functions directly. These programs were meant to aid assignments, quizzes, and exams, and needed to be readily accessible and easy to call.
